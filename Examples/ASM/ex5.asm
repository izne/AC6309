; Embedded string printer. Examines the stack to find the embedded
; string right after the call to this routine. Outputs one character
; at a time until a 0 marker is found. Then it returns to the calling
; program just beyond the string. Note: If you forget the terminating
; zero marker, it will likely crash on return.
